<span class="firstword">In</span> compiling this volume we have endeavored
to add pictorially to the amusement
in these funny conceits from Field’s
versatile brain.</p>

<p>The majority of the sketches herein, appeared
in the Denver <cite>Tribune</cite>, under the title of <cite>The
Tribune Primer</cite>, with various sub-titles, beginning
Monday, Oct. 10, 1881, and ending Monday,
Dec. 19, of the same year. The entire number
of these quips was about 162, of which 94 were
first published in book form as <cite>The Tribune
Primer</cite>, in 1881. The balance, with the exception
of five which are so local in their application
that they have now lost some of their fine sarcastic
humor, we here present for the first time
with illustrations.</p>

<p>In their original form the sketches were
designated by Roman Numerals instead of titles
and were made up of short sentences, with a
liberal display of capital letters after the style
of first lessons in reading for children.</p>

<p class="idc"><img src="images/i_idco.png" width="208" height="252" alt="O">
<span class="firstword">Once</span> upon a Time there was a Bad boy
whose Name was Reginald and there
was a Good boy whose Name was James.
Reginald would go Fishing when his
Mamma told him Not to, and he Cut off the
Cat’s Tail with the Bread Knife one Day, and
then told Mamma the Baby had Driven it in
with the Rolling Pin, which was a Lie. James
was always Obedient, and when his Mamma
told him not to Help an old Blind Man across
the street or Go into a Dark Room where the
Boogies were, he always Did What She said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
That is why they Called him Good James.
Well, by and by, along Came Christmas.
Mamma said, You have been so Bad, my son
Reginald, you will not Get any Presents from
Santa Claus this Year; but you, my Son James,
will get Oodles of Presents, because you have
Been Good. Will you Believe it, Children,
that Bad boy Reginald said he didn’t Care a
Darn and he Kicked three Feet of Veneering off
the Piano just for Meanness. Poor James was
so sorry for Reginald that he cried for Half an
Hour after he Went to Bed that Night. Reginald
lay wide Awake until he saw James was Asleep
and then he Said if these people think they can
Fool me, they are Mistaken. Just then Santa
Claus came down the Chimney. He had lots of
Pretty Toys in a Sack on his Back. Reginald
shut his Eyes and Pretended to be Asleep.
Then Santa Claus Said, Reginald is Bad and I
will not Put any nice Things in his Stocking.
But as for you, James, I will Fill your Stocking
Plumb full of Toys, because You are Good. So
Santa Claus went to Work and Put, Oh! heaps
and Heaps of Goodies in James’ stocking but
not a Sign of a Thing in Reginald’s stocking.
And then he Laughed to himself and Said, I
guess Reginald will be Sorry to-morrow because
he Was so Bad. As he said this he Crawled up
the chimney and rode off in his Sleigh. Now
you can Bet your Boots Reginald was no Spring
Chicken. He just Got right Straight out of Bed
and changed all those Toys and Truck from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
James’ stocking into his own. Santa Claus will
Have to Sit up all Night, said He, when he
Expects to get away with my Baggage. The
next morning James got out of Bed and when
He had Said his Prayers he Limped over to his
Stocking, licking his chops and Carrying his
Head as High as a Bull going through a Brush
Fence. But when he found there was Nothing
in his stocking and that Reginald’s Stocking was
as Full as Papa Is when he comes home Late
from the Office, he Sat down on the Floor and
began to Wonder why on Earth he had Been
such a Good boy. Reginald spent a Happy
Christmas and James was very Miserable. After
all, Children, it Pays to be Bad, so Long as you
Combine Intellect with Crime.</p>

<p class="tb">❦</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln once said, “God must love plain
people, because he made so many of them.” Then
humor must be heaven born, because it glorifies the
commonplace.</p>

<p>Mr. Fuller’s humor has no need of the finger post of
an introduction. His manner bears no stamp save that
of his own personality. His characters introduce themselves
as old friends, who try to surprise us by thinly
disguised voices, by the change of a beard, or the innocent
assumption of ignorance of our identity. The
people concerning whom Mr. Fuller writes in these
chronicles, he would have us believe dwell in Maine.
But I knew them in Illinois; you have them in New
York; they are your neighbors in California. We recognize
them as old friends. Some busy years have
separated us; a multitude of cares have swarmed into
our lives and driven them out of our thought, and
grateful are we that this apostle of humor suddenly
turns the limelight of his humor upon the stage of this
old work-a-day world of ours, revealing the little group
of actors to our gaze saying, “Did you ever see these
people before?” And our ready, happy looks of glad
and instant recognition contradict our “No we never
did” that goes with the extended hand of welcome
greeting. Into his book, Mr. Fuller has put the laughter
of our own lives. Our highest and most grateful
appreciation of what he has done, will be to take the
laughter of his book into our own hearts.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling
inconsistencies were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>This book does not have a Table of Contents
or a List of Illustrations.</p>

<p>The original book used leaf-like symbols
as separators or decorations. This eBook uses
❦ for all of them, and Transcriber added a
few more at the bottoms of what were pages
in the original book.</p>
